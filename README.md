# python-challenge

In this project, I had two seperate goals: one was to write a script that would analyze financial records of a given company and the second goal was to write a script that would calculate vote counts for a rural town's election data.
For the first project under the name PyBank, I wrote a python script that analyzed profit and loss data by month contained in a CSV file to calculate and identify a few different items including: 

-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

For the second project with the name PyPoll, I wrote another python script that would analyze data from another CSV file and calculated and identified the following:

-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote
